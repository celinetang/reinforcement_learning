This project is to about Reinforcement learning

Code environments with OpenAIGym

Atari games have been a very important subject in the history of reinforcement learning (and the history of video games) since Deep Mind developed models that managed to achieve super human performance on these games. However Atari has limited access to their game emulators, so we'll not be able to use this branch of the library unfortunately.
